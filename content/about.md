The workshop covers different aspects of the performance of frontend. It's not about how to make your server work or respond faster. It's about what frontend developers can do with the tools familiar to them. Exemplary plan (actual plan can be to a certain degree different though) of the workshop:

## Objective performance

In this sections we will discuss performance from the absolute numbers' side. We will review why performance matters, take a look at the tools for measuring and monitoring performance, review examples. Practical application of the techniques like: JS, images, CSS optimisations, web fonts and so on.

## Subjective (psychological performance)

This part will be dedicated to how we perceive performance as the end users. We will get into the examples of how to manipulate perception and use this perception as a standalone tool that we can use in performance optimisations. We will also review examples when faster can be not what your users or even you really need and performance in the classical sense might harm the project.
